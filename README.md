## Work in progress

This is a work-in-progress re-write of SkelePlex. Currently, nothing is working. Please check back later!

## Development installation

First, fork the library and clone your fork to your local computer. `cd` into the cloned directory.

```bash

cd path/to/skeleplex-v2
```

We recommend installinginto a fresh environment. Activate your skeleplex environment and then install in editable mode with the optional developer and testing dependencies

```bash

pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
```

Finally, install the pre-commit git hooks. These will apply the linting before you commit your changes.


```bash
pre-commit install
```
