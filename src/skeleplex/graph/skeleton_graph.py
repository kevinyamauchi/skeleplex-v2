        slice_spacing : float
            The spacing between slices. Normalized between 0 and 1.

            The order of the interpolation to use for the spline.

            The maximum generation of the spline to sample.

        approx : bool
            If True, use a quick conversion from normalized arc length
            coordinates to spline parameter coordinates.
            The more evenly spaced the spline knots are, the more accurate this
            approximation becomes.

            that corresponds to the normalized arc length coordinates.

            A dictionary of image slices.

        Optional: tuple(dict, dict)
            A tuple of dictionaries of image and segmentation slices.
