    Compute normalized distance transform for a binary image.

    This algorithm computes the distance transform for each connected component

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : np.ndarray
        Binary array where non-zero values are interpreted as foreground.
    max_ball_radius : int
        Maximum radius of the ball used for maximum filtering.
